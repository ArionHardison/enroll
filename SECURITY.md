## Vulnerability Mitigations

### CVE-2024-21510 - Sinatra

**Vulnerability:** Sinatra vulnerable to Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision

**Mitigation:** This vulnerability affects Sinatra when used for parsing HTTP requests. In our application, Sinatra is not directly used for this purpose. It is a dependency of Resque, which we use for background job processing. The vulnerable component of Sinatra is not exercised in our usage context, therefore the risk is minimal.

**Actions Taken:**
1. We have documented this issue and our mitigation strategy.
2. We are monitoring for updates to Resque that might include a patched version of Sinatra.
3. We have verified that our usage of Resque does not expose Sinatra to untrusted input in our application setup.
4. We have configured bundler-audit to ignore this specific vulnerability in our CI/CD pipeline.

**Ongoing Measures:**
1. Regular review of dependencies and their security advisories.
2. Periodic assessment of our usage of Resque to ensure it remains unexposed to the vulnerable Sinatra components.
